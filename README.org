* Homework on 2D vector structure

The project implements a 2-dimensional vector as a structure with several overloaded operators and convenient methods, including:
- ~+~ vector summation
- ~-~ vector subtraction
- ~*~ scalar product
- ~*~ the product of a vector by a scalar
- ~/~ dividing a vector by a scalar
- the unary operator ~-~
- two shorthand operators: ~+=~, ~-=~
- comparison operators: ~==~, ~!=~
- calculating the ~length()~ of a vector
- normalization of the vector ~normalize()~

** Building

*** With Nix

This project comes with a flake, for those lucky Nix users to build and run the project it's enough to execute:
#+begin_src shell
nix run github:seajoyer/Vector_structure --impure
#+end_src shell

You also can start an isolated development shell with all the dependencies by simply running:
#+begin_src shell
nix develop github:seajoyer/Vector_structure
#+end_src shell

*** Manually

**** Prerequisites

First, install dependencies, this is done differently in different systems:

- [[https://gcc.gnu.org/][g++]] compiler
- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download][Make]] build system

**** Building & Running

1. Clone the repository:
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/seajoyer/Vector_structure
   cd Vector_structure
   #+end_src shell
2. And once you are ready:

   ~make~ to build

   ~make run~ to build & run

   ~make clean~ to clean the ~build~ directory

   ~make help~ to see a help message
